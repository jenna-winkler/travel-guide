# BeeAI Platform Agent Template

This repository provides a template for creating a Python agent that can be used with the [BeeAI Platform](https://docs.beeai.dev).

## Overview

BeeAI agents are Python-based services that can be run locally or deployed to the BeeAI Platform. Each agent exposes specific functionality through the ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) which is implemented via SDK.

In this template, you'll find:
- A basic agent implementation
- Docker configuration for deployment
- Project structure for building your own agents

## Project Structure

```sh
├── src/                                    # Source code directory
│   └── beeai_agents/                       # Python package directory
│       ├── __init__.py                     # Package initialization (empty)
│       └── agent.py                        # Agent implementations (main file you'll modify)
├── Dockerfile                              # Container configuration for deployment
├── pyproject.toml                          # Package metadata and dependencies
├── uv.lock                                 # Dependency lock file (generated by UV)
└── README.md                               # Project documentation
```

**Key files to focus on:**

- `agent.py`: This is where you'll implement your agent logic
- `pyproject.toml`: Update this if you need to add dependencies
- `Dockerfile`: Modify if you need special deployment configuration

## Requirements

- [BeeAI Platform](https://docs.beeai.dev/introduction/quickstart) installed
- Python 3.11 or higher
- [UV package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your project**. Start by using this template for your own agent. You may use this as a template or fork this repository.

2. **Install dependencies** using `uv sync`.

3. **Implement your agent** by modifying the source code located in [src/beeai_agents/server.py](src/beeai_agents/agent.py).

Here's an example of the included template agent:

```py
@server.agent(
    metadata=Metadata(ui={"type": "hands-off"})
)
async def example_agent(input: list[Message], context: Context) -> AsyncGenerator[RunYield, RunYieldResume]:
    """Polite agent that greets the user"""
    hello_template: str = os.getenv("HELLO_TEMPLATE", "Ciao %s!")
    yield MessagePart(content=hello_template % str(input[-1]))
```

Modify this file to implement your own agent's logic. Here are some key points to consider when creating your agent:
- The function name (example_agent above) is used as the unique id for the agent in the platform. You can override this in the metadata.
- The docstring is used as the agent's description in the platform UI. You can also override this in the metadata.
- The `@server.agent()` decorator registers your function as an agent and can customize its appearance and behavior
- Your agent receives messages in the `input` list, with the most recent message at the end
- Return responses using `yield MessagePart(content="text")`
- Access conversation context through the `context` parameter

> [!TIP]
> You can define multiple agents in the same service by creating additional decorated functions.

4. **Update project metadata and dependencies** in the `pyproject.toml` file. After updating, synchronize with `uv sync`.

## Running Agents Locally

To test your agent locally:

```sh
# Start the agent server
uv run server
```

This will start a local server on http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default. You'll get an output similar to:

```
INFO:     Started server process [86448]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Your agents should now be started on http://localhost:8000. You can verify your agents are running with the BeeAI CLI:

```sh
# List available agents
beeai list

# Run the example agent
beeai run example_agent "Your Name"
```

## Adding Agents to BeeAI Platform

There are two ways to add your agent to the BeeAI Platform:

### Local Development Mode

When running agents locally with `uv run server`, they are automatically registered with the BeeAI Platform. In this mode:
- The BeeAI Platform will communicate with your local server
- You manage the agent's lifecycle (starting/stopping)
- Changes are immediately available without redeployment

### Deployment from GitHub

To share your agent with others or deploy it to the BeeAI Platform:

- Push your agent code to a GitHub repository
- Add the agent to BeeAI using: `beeai add https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name`

The BeeAI Platform will automatically:
- Clone your repository
- Build a Docker image
- Start the agent container
- Extract agent configuration directly from the `/agents` endpoint
- Register the agent in the platform

#### Version Management

- For stable versions, use Git tags (e.g., `agents-v0.0.1`)
- When adding a tagged version: `beeai add https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name@agents-v0.0.1`
- To update: remove the old version (`beeai remove <agent-name>`) and add the new one

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Status

To check the status of your agents:

```sh
# List all agents and their status
beeai list
```

### Logs

- **Local agents:** View logs directly in the terminal where you ran `uv run server`
- **Managed agents:** Use `beeai logs <agent-id>` to view logs
- **BeeAI server logs:** Check `/opt/homebrew/var/log/beeai-server.log` (default location)
